# WARNING: THIS DESCRIPTION IS INCOMPLETE #

More thorough directions for Mac and Linux are coming very shortly. We are also working to automate as much as possible, to keep this simple.

Changes in process
--------------------
I am adding dependencies on OCaml batteries included and sexplib. On Ubuntu or similar, these are available via:

	sudo apt-get install libsexplib-camlp4-dev ocaml-batteries-included

On OS X, I recommend using [ODB](https://github.com/thelema/odb/) to install additional OCaml packages (sexplib, batteries).

Summary
-------
- Install OCaml (3.12.*)  
  (On Mac, just use Homebrew: `brew install objective-caml`, or MacPorts: `sudo port install ocaml`)

- Install GCC 4.6/4.7 - `g++-mp-4.6` or `g++-mp-4.7` must be in your `$PATH`  
  (On Mac, Homebrew is highly recommended: `brew
install https://raw.github.com/adamv/homebrew-alt/master/duplicates/gcc.rb --enable-cxx`)

- `./bootstrap` to build everything (and wait -- this builds all of LLVM, which takes a while)

- `cd test; ./run_test cpp/*`

- Check out `test/cpp/*` and `apps/*` for examples of how to get started.

- _OPTIONAL:_ `source ./bash_profile` to configure llvm paths for current session (if you want llvm tools in your path for manual use, or for use by static build `Makefile`s like those in some of `apps/*`).  
  **TODO: hard code LLVM paths in Makefiles to make this really optional again.**


Build env notes
---------------
- ensure clang sub-submodule (llvm/tools/clang) is updated and checked out at branch matching llvm (optional: if you want to have a clang for this llvm build)
- put ignores in [llvm,llvm/tools/clang]/.git/info/exclude to keep built dir clean
- configure llvm for debug+asserts during development:
    `./configure --enable-assertions`
- enable all targets (e.g. for arm):
    `./configure --enable-targets=all`


Debugging notes
---------------
To make OCaml print useful stack trace info on uncaught exceptions, build a bytecode target with debugging (<target>.d.byte) and set the OCAMLRUNPARAM environment variable to include the "b" (backtrace) option. (Cf. [the OCaml runtime system docs](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/manual024.html#toc96) for more.)
