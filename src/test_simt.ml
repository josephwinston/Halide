(* 
For now, SIMT doesn't support:

- anything that generates an alloca

And has bugs which require manual patches of the output LLVM bitcode:

- main entrypoint should have calling convention qualifier "ptx_kernel void @_im_main"
- other functions must have convention "ptx_device"
- PTX thread ID intrinsics get codegenerated with their dotted name components mangled. Replace e.g. @x with @llvm.ptx.read.tid.x()
- _im_main_runner trampoline should be dropped (no support for device function calls)

All that said, this actually generates PTX once patched with:

    llc-mp-4.7 -O0 -march=ptx32 -o=/dev/stdout < test_simt.ll > test_simt.ptx

and compiles with:

    ptxas -v test_simt.ptx -o test_simt.o               # -v prints interesting info
    cuobjdump --dump-sass test_simt.o > test_simt.sass  # print out actual SASS machine code
